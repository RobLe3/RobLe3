ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @RobLee

A systems strategist focused on creating architectures that connect intelligence, security, and purpose. Over time, the work evolved from technical precision to integrative design, aligning structure, reasoning, and ethical reflection into coherent frameworks.

Each project builds on a shared foundation of communication, autonomy, and accountability in intelligent systems.

IICP â€“ Intent-based Inter-agent Communication Protocol explores how independent AI agents can exchange intent, context, and purpose securely and efficiently, forming the basis for scalable, transparent collaboration between intelligent systems.

ANEOS â€“ Artificial Near-Earth Object Suite investigates anomalous behaviors in celestial trajectories, applying analytical methods to evaluate whether observed motion patterns could reflect engineered or non-random influences.

The guiding principle remains to design systems where complexity serves clarity, and technology enhances human understanding rather than obscuring it. The current focus is on advancing architectures that can communicate, reason, and evolve responsibly, within frameworks built on transparency and long-term trust.
